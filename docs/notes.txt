Participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions
of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fash-
ions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throw-
ing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell
only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway
(Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

For feature extraction we used a sliding window approach
with different lengths from 0.5 second to 2.5 seconds, with
0.5 second overlap

 For the Euler angles of each of the
four sensors we calculated eight features: mean, variance,
standard deviation, max, min, amplitude, kurtosis and skew-
ness, generating in total 96 derived feature sets

 17 features were selected:
in the belt, were selected the mean and variance of the roll,
maximum, range and variance of the accelerometer vector,
variance of the gyro and variance of the magnetometer

the arm, the variance of the accelerometer vector and the
maximum and minimum of the magnetometer were selected.
In the dumbbell, the selected features were the maximum of
the acceleration, variance of the gyro and maximum and
minimum of the magnetometer, while in the glove, the sum
of the pitch and the maximum and minimum of the gyro
were selected.


They use random forest with bagging. We used 10 random forests and each forest was
implemented with 10 trees. The classifier was tested with
10-fold cross-validation and different windows sizes, all of
them with 0.5s overlapping (except the window with 0.5s).
